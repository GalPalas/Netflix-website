## Introduction
Welcome to our website, a platform inspired by the popular streaming service, Netflix. Our platform is designed to provide users with a seamless and enjoyable experience when watching their favorite TV shows and movies.

### Technologies Used
To build this site, I used the following technologies:

- React: React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. We chose to use React for its component-based architecture, which makes it easy to build complex and interactive user interfaces. React also has a large and active community, which means there are many resources and libraries available to use.

- JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language that is widely used for web development. We used JavaScript to add interactivity to our website, such as dynamic content loading and user input handling.

- Bootstrap: Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework that provides a collection of pre-built components and styles to use in web development. We used Bootstrap to make our website responsive and to speed up the development process.

- Bootstrap Icons: Bootstrap Icons is a free icon set provided by Bootstrap. We used Bootstrap Icons to add high-quality icons throughout our website, making it easier for users to navigate and understand.

Overall, these technologies help us to create a fast, responsive, and user-friendly website that provides a great streaming experience for our users.
